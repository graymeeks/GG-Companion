# GG-Companion
Repository description: Back-end files for a mobile 'companion' app for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 zombies mode. Front-end was mainly wordpress plus some HTML/CSS changes I made to personalize the website to better suit the application.

Application description: GG Companion allows Black Ops 3 players to keep track of their gobblegum probabilities throughout their match. Gobblegums are one of the most essential gameplay aspects of BO3 zombies, so this takes some of the guesswork out of the gobblegum consumption process.
