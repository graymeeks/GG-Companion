# GG-Companion
**Repository description**: Back-end files for a mobile 'companion' app for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 zombies mode. Front-end was mainly wordpress plus some HTML/CSS changes I made to personalize the website to better suit the application.

**Application description**: GG Companion allows Black Ops 3 players to keep track of their gobblegum probabilities throughout their match. Gobblegums are one of the most essential gameplay aspects of BO3 zombies, so this takes some of the guesswork out of the gobblegum consumption process.

**What is a gobblegum?**

A gobblegum is a consumable booster-type item in Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 zombies mode. You select five unique gobblegums before starting a match, and during the match you can receive up to three of those per round. The first gobblegum is free, and the second two are priced according to how many "rounds" or "waves" you have made it into the game. Gobblegums follow a uniform probability pattern, meaning that if you roll a particular gobblegum you won't roll it again until all the other four gobblegums have been rolled. Once the five distinct gobblegums have been consumed, all gums become available to roll once again.
